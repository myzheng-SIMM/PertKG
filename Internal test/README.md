## Internal test to find a more generalizable link prediction algorithm
  Considering the standard paradigm of causal reasoning (causal reasoning = predefined prior knowledge network (PKN) + scoring function), an internal test in LINCS Phase I was conducted to identify a more generalizable link prediction algorithm for PertKG's scoring function.
