# PertKG: a knowledge graph-based causal reasoning method facilitating compound-protein interactions prediction
Compound-protein interactions prediction based on transcriptomic data provides a new perspective and opportunity for drug discovery. In this work, we propose a new knowledge graph-based method, called PertKG, to more systematically simulates chemical perturbation without confusing semantic, facilitating causal reasoning. By conducting a thorough analysis of its generalization capabilities on internal testing, PertKG demonstrates enhanced predictive performance in real-world scenarios. This proficiency enables PertKG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in both targets fishing and actives screening tasks during external testing. Our experiments also demonstrate that PertKG exhibits unique capabilities in multi-omics analysis, which is crucial for enhancing the predictive power. Moreover, PertKG led to the discovery of five new hits for the key cancer therapeutic target, ALDH1B1, with high hit rate (10.2%) and identified the mechanism of action of a drug-like small molecule with potential immune activity.
